# WiCS-Hackathon-CAT
This is a repository of team CAT. Members: Zhou Fan, Katherine Mundey.

# Purpose:  
To generate customized selfie images with a Barbie at different UT landmarks. Users can upload their own selfie image at the very beginning. For convenience, we will use the selfie of Matthew McConaughey (Hollywood movie star & professor at UT) as an example of the userâ€™s uploaded selfie and demonstrate its functionality.
